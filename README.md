# Exploring Haskell

This repository contains some experiments I conduct when playing around with Haskells and especially GHCs capabilities.
Each topic will receive its own module and should contain some comments, where I deemed them necessary.
If any wanderer finds themself stranding here, may your search be successful and maybe you can get something out of this repository here.

# Topics
* [Studies on dependent Haskell/dependent types within Haskell](https://github.com/ndzik/explore-haskell/tree/main/src/DependentTypes)
